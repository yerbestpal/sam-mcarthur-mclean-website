        <p>Current Position: Game Designer at Aurorian Studios working on One Lonely Outpost</p>
        <p>
            My name is Samuel Mcarthur-Mclean, I am a game designer from Glasgow and have just been awarded a First
            Class Honours degree in Computer Games Design from Glasgow Caledonian University. I am looking for a
            job as a game designer at an ambitious studio.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2019 I was able to attend an event called Resonate to show off one of my games, Cyber Sphere allowing
            the public to play it. This experience was valuable in helping me grow as a designer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another game I worked on called Novoslavia was downloaded by a youtuber who did a let’s play, with it
            currently having over 370,000 views. The response from viewers was very positive towards the game and
            even led to a few hundred downloads of the it.
        </p>
        <p>
            My influences come from a wide variety of genres, from cyberpunk to Korean cinema to Scottish novels,
            all coming together to make something interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            From 2014 – 2017 I worked as a journalist where I wrote news, reviews and previews from events such as
            EGX. Going to events like these and meeting developers made me realize I wanted to make games and not
            just write about them.

            This is a game I that I worked as a designer on. Our Client, a company called We Throw Switches wanted an
            arcade game with a unique control scheme. I came up with the idea of a four-player game where the players
            would play using trackballs. This worked out well and the university even pushed the game at their showcase
            events, which led to us being given the chance to demo it as Scotland’s biggest gaming event Resonate.

            I did everything from the design, art and programming for this project. This was created as a game to show

            upgrades to a building showing its stats before and after highlighting what needs improved and the money
            saved by making energy efficient. I tried to give it a vibrant look to draw people into the game.

            When designing games and mechanics I like to have the player learn subconsciously rather than being told
            through text what to do. The ability for games to teach complex systems to players in an intuitive way is
            something that interests me. For example, when it came to designing these elements in Cyber Sphere, symbols
            and colours were used rather than text to explain what the players were meant to do.

            The chance the show a game I had worked on at a convention was valuable experience for me. It felt I had
            come full circle from covering them as a journalist to now showing off a game there. The reception from
            people was great to see with groups of friends laughing and smiling as they played against each other. It
            gave me good experience in demoing and interacting with players.

            As one of the things that interests me about design is teaching players information through mechanics. This
            game aims to teach people about cyber security. Games normally teach the players their systems whereas this
            game looks at teaching real life information. The game takes place in a virtual desktop that offers
            different challenges and puzzles talking the player through a story of cyber security.

            This was project I started to try and experiment with different genres. It’s a 2D pixel art game about
            fishing that isn’t really about fishing. It starts off pretty simple but then progresses into over the top
            things like catching fish with a rhythm game and turning into a side scrolling shoot’em up.

            The 3D city was included was inspired by modern day cities Asia. It was meant to be somewhere off the beaten

            feel.  A hidden garden on the roof offers a place of relaxation from the street below. It was to be
